## Key Features

### 🚀 Hybrid Search Engine

- **Global Reach**: Automatically falls back to Notion Cloud Search for items not in the cache.

- **Import to Raycast**: One-click import (`Cmd+Shift+I`) to Raycast's native Snippet Manager.
- **Rich Metadata**: View detailed info like tags, database source, and full titles in the sidebar.
- **Safe Archiving**: Deleting a snippet (`Ctrl+X`) archives it in Notion, so you never lose data.

### 🧠 Smart & Flexible

- **Microblogs Support**: Automatically handles untitled posts by using the content as the title.
- **Bookmarks**: Intelligent URL parsing for bookmark databases.
- **Multi-Database**: Connect and search across multiple Notion databases simultaneously.

## How it works

3. **Search**: Use Raycast to search, copy, paste, or import your Notion snippets instantly.
